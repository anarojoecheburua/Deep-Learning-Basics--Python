    "In this notebook, we are going to use RNNs to pefrom sentiment analysis using Keras, a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of TensorFlow. We will be using the IMDB movie review sentiment classification datset. This is a dataset of 25,000 movies reviews from IMDB, labeled by sentiment (positive/negative). Reviews have been preprocessed, and each review is encoded as a list of word indexes (integers). For convenience, words are indexed by overall frequency in the dataset, so that for instance the integer \"3\" encodes the 3rd most frequent word in the data. More information on this dataset can be found here: https://keras.io/datasets/#imdb-movie-reviews-sentiment-classification"
